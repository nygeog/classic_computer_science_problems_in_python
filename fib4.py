"""
Python has a built-in decorator for memoizing any function automagically. In
fib4(), the decorator @functools.lru_cache() is used with the same exact code as
we used in fib2(). Each time fib4() is executed with a novel argument, the
decorator causes the return value ot be cached. Upon future calls of fib4() with
the same argument, the previous return value of fib4() for that argument is
retrieved from the cache and returned
